- **Assessment**: We will investigate and assess the vulnerability within **7 days**.
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to release a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities within **30 days**, depending on complexity.
- **Disclosure**: Once a fix is released, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing.

We will keep you informed throughout the process and credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

To protect our users, we ask that you:

- **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.
- **DO NOT** exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- **DO NOT** access, modify, or delete data belonging to other users.
- **DO** provide us with reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

We are committed to working with security researchers and will not take legal action against individuals who discover and report vulnerabilities responsibly.
